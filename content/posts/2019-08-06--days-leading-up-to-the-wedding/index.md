## Days leading up to the wedding

* David and Amy finally meet in person. In the beginning, he was afraid he'd mess up and drop her, having exactly zero experience with babies, but Amy soon got him wrapped around her little finger.

* The stag night for David, of course.

* Amy and Rose also spend time together.

* Dad and daughter took a nap (we were both still getting over our respective colds, and tired from the travelling)

* Karen went for a walk up the local hill, and took a few photos.
